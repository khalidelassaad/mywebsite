# About Me

My name is **Khalid Elassaad**.

> Hello there!

I'm a 25-year-old Lebanese-American technology professional based in Seattle, Washington.

I graduated Cum Laude from [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/) in 2018 with a B.S. in Computer Science. I am especially proud of my achievements as an undergraduate researcher, honors student, and student athlete.

I spent the first 3 years after college working at [Tableau Software](https://www.tableau.com/). I worked as a Software Engineer for 2 years and a Product Manager for 1 year.

In this time, I learned a lot about how software companies operate, how I like to work, what motivates me and strengthens my resolve, what demotivates me and weakens my ambition.

Since leaving, I've been diving into the world of web3 and getting my hands dirty with these emerging technologies. To re-engage my coding skills, I've been participating in hackathons and building this website from scratch!

I speak English, Arabic, and Spanish.

In my free time, I like to read, play chess, rollerblade, make music, practice Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, practice yoga, go backpacking, breathe deeply, and of course, spend time with my dog Hammer!

And yes, my favorite color is, in fact, green!
