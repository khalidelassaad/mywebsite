Do ya like prime numbers?

This is a simple pair of scripts written that produce an Ulam spiral and a random spiral (with the same percentage of white squares as the Ulam spiral) in `tkinter`. The program does not use a [sieve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) to determine if a number is prime. Instead, it uses the slower method of calculating modulo every number up to the inputâ€™s square root.

I watched the YouTube video linked above and thought it was interesting, so I decided to recreate it.
