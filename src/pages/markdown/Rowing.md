# Rowing

---

I walked on UC Irvine’s Men’s Rowing team in Fall, 2014.

Coming into college, I was not an athlete. Chubby and out-of-shape, I joined the rowing team only because I wanted to row a boat. I quickly learned that rowing is an extremely demanding and competitive team sport. The Irvine crew practices start before sunrise, at 5:15 AM on weekdays and at 6:00 AM on Saturdays. Each practice requires 90 minutes to 2 hours of grueling physical work and mind-numbing levels of focus and attention. Never in my life had I attempted anything as physically and mentally demanding as trying to become a collegiate oarsman.

Never have I had so much fun.

In my freshman year, I lost 25 pounds. For the first time in my life, I could see my abs. I was competing against top schools and beating teams of guys who wake up just as early as we did to do the same thing we do. It was a blast.

My second year culminated in my first major victory.

It is a tradition of intercollegiate men’s rowing that the winner of an event be awarded a school shirt from all other competing athletes in the event. After winning the ACRA National Championship in 2016, we each took home about 30 shirts from schools all over the nation, as well as our own shirts that we successfully defended. These spoils of war are more valuable to me than the gold medals we won. Each shirt represents the hard work of another athlete fighting for his school. To have a competing oarsman hand you his shirt is a high honor.

Since then we’ve won and lost many races across many different events. Rowing has taught me that hard work pays off immensely, but not always immediately. I spent my 4 years as an undergraduate student waking up before sunrise and sweating gallons to hone my skill and physical ability. It isn’t always a rise to glory. Sometimes the work is grueling and demanding and all you want to do is be in a warm cozy bed just like almost everyone else in your time zone. Rowing has required tremendous quantities of energy, love, dedication, and sacrifice.

And goddammit, I did well in class anyways. I’m very proud of my status as an honors student on campus. I see my GPA as a reflection of not only my academic ability, but also my capacity to learn better and achieve more than I thought possible despite the additional load I bear with my athletic commitments. I worked extremely hard to do well on the water and in the classroom and I’m very satisfied with my performance on both ends. The journey has been long and I emerge feeling proud and accomplished.

Onto the next challenge!
